# What is google-chart-in-pdf-via-VF-page

I wrote this code back in 2015 for a requirement where I had to generate a PDF with Google Chart in it. You can view more details on the blog post here. 

While this Apex Code and VF page approach still works in Classic and Lightning experience, there might be other ways to achieve this using Lightning Components. I just thought of adding this code to github as centralized library.
